# Beta-Frogger
On a Saturday morning, me and my friend Kenji decided to work together and make a recreation of Frogger. Since i sent him my version of Frogger (It's horrible) he decided to help me make a better verssion of the game. So there we go, we planned that we'll be finished by the end of the weekend. But we were wrong, what planned to be a 2 day game turned to be a 1 and a half weeks of Coding and editing...

# Plan
We used a Javascript Library called p5.js to make our game, the Web Editor, and all the code are above. 

# Beta Frogger
Here is our Result, have fun! > https://mdbrim.github.io/frogger/index.html
