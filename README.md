# Beta-Frogger
On a Saturday morning, me and my friend decided to work together and make a recreation of Frogger. Since i sent him my version of Frogger (It's horrible) he decided to help me make a better verssion of the game. So there we go, we planned that we'll be finished by the end of the weekend. But we were wrong, what planned to be a 2 day game turned to be a 1 and a half weeks of Coding and editing... So, where's the result? Here it is.
